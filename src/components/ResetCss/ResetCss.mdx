# ResetCss

This is a basic component containing global styles that reset box-sizing, margin, and padding on all of the html elements.
It is meant to be included somewhere in the top level of your application.

```js
import { ResetCss } from 'basic-styled-uikit';

// root level component
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <ResetCss />
    {/* rest of your top level components */}
  </div>
);
```
