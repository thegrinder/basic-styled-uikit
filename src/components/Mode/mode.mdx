## **ModeProvider**

`<ModeProvider />` is responsible for passing down the current mode down to all the components below in the tree as well as passing it into styled-components' theme. Also, it passes down a method to toggle the mode between `light` and `dark`.

<Props of={ModeProvider} />


---


## **useMode**

`useMode` is a hook that gives us access to the current mode (`light` or `dark`) and a method `toggleMethod` to switch between them.

### Example

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const Example = () => {
      const { mode, toggleMode } = useMode();
      return (
        <div>
          <p>you're currently viewing <b>{mode}</b> mode</p>
          <button onClick={toggleMode}>
            toggle mode
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    };

    return (
      <ModeProvider>
        <Example />
      </ModeProvider>
    );
  }}
