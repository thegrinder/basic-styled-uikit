# Installation

## npm

Basic-styled-uikit is [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-styled-uikit) and it can be installed using npm or yarn.

```
# Using npm
npm install basic-styled-uikit --save

# Using Yarn
yarn add basic-styled-uikit
```

## setup

Basic-styled-uikit uses styled-components under the hood and that's why you have to wrap your application with its `<ThemeProvider>`
in order to use it. We also provide you with a theme so you can get going right away.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import theme from 'basic-styled-uikit/theme';

// root component
const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {/* rest of your top level components */}
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```
