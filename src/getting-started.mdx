# Getting started

## Motivation

### Simple customization

There are plenty of great css libraries out there that make your development easier and faster. However, I tried quite a few of them and every time I tried to customize the components and bend them to my will, I was running into problems. My biggest issue was the amount of extra code that would ultimately defeat the purpose of using the library in the first place. I wanted something small, simple and customizable that could serve as a component base for almost any project.

### Dark mode

Basic-styled-uikit has support for dark mode. Most of the css libraries support it only partially; it's mostly limited to certain set of components (i.e. button, cards). If you ever tried adding a dark mode to your application, you're probably aware that inverting colors is just not enough. That's why basic-styled-uikit has an extensive theme system that let's you have complete control over the look of your components in light as well as dark mode.

### Theming

Most of the libraries are themeable and they usually offer a way to modify theme variables (colors, font sizes, etc.). However, I found that these central themes are either too simple (e.g. inverting colors in dark mode) or too complex to safely change (e.g. what is this shade of grey used for?). That's why you have multiple independent themes in basic-styled-uikit that are responsible for specific group of components.

### Technology

There are a lot of different technologies used for styling and each library picks one which ultimately affect (or even determines) the way you write css. Basic-styled-uikit is no exception and it uses styled-components under the hood. However, the only thing it imposes on you is to pass properly structured style object to theme providers and that's it. Apart from that, you're free to use whatever technology you want.


## Installation

Basic-styled-uikit is [available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basic-styled-uikit) and it can be installed using npm or yarn.

```
# Using npm
npm install basic-styled-uikit --save

# Using Yarn
yarn add basic-styled-uikit
```

## Quick setup

Basic-styled-uikit uses styled-components under the hood and that's why you have to wrap your application with a few theme providers responsible for passing style down to its respective copmonents. The quickest way to get going is to install and use the default theme.

```
# Using npm
npm install basic-styled-uikit-theme --save

# Using Yarn
yarn add basic-styled-uikit-theme
```

```js
// root component
import React from 'react';

// basic-styled-uikit providers
import {
  ModeProvider,
  TypographyProvider,
  ButtonProvider,
  ColorBoxProvider,
  LinkProvider,
  FormProvider,
  ColorsProvider,
  } from 'basic-styled-uikit';

// respective themes from basic-styled-uikit-theme
import {
  typographyTheme,
  buttonTheme,
  colorBoxTheme,
  linkTheme,
  formTheme,
  colorsTheme,
} from 'basic-styled-uikit-theme';


const App = ({ children }) => (
  <ModeProvider>
    <TypographyProvider theme={typographyTheme.base} darkTheme={typographyTheme.dark}>
      <ColorBoxProvider theme={colorBoxTheme} darkTheme={colorBoxTheme.dark}>
        <ButtonProvider theme={buttonTheme} darkTheme={buttonTheme.dark}>
          <LinkProvider theme={linkTheme} darkTheme={linkTheme.dark}>
            <FormProvider theme={formTheme} darkTheme={formTheme.dark}>
              <ColorsProvider theme={colorsTheme} darkTheme={colorsTheme.dark}>
                <>{children}</>
              </ColorsProvider>
            </FormProvider>
          </LinkProvider>
        </ButtonProvider>
      </ColorBoxProvider>
    </TypographyProvider>
  </ModeProvider>
);

App.propTypes = propTypes;

export default App;
```
