Basic-styled-uikit is a react UI components library built with styled-components. There are a lot of great UI libraries that offer complete set of components, from simple buttons to more complex ones such as dropdowns or datepickers. Basic-styled-uikit is minimal on purpose. It provides only small (usually just one html tag) components and an easy way to add/customize their variations by using the theme. In other words, it takes care of the basics and leaves the rest up to you.

## Motivation

### Simple customization

I tried quite a few of popular css libraries and every time I tried to customize the components and bend them to my will, I was running into problems. My biggest issue was the amount of extra code that would ultimately defeat the purpose of using the library in the first place. I wanted something small, simple and customizable that could serve as a component base for almost any project.

### Dark mode

Basic-styled-uikit has support for dark mode. Most of the css libraries support it only partially; it's mostly limited to certain set of components (i.e. button, cards). If you ever tried adding a dark mode to your application, you're probably aware that inverting colors is just not enough. That's why basic-styled-uikit has an extensive theme system that let's you have complete control over the look of your components in light as well as dark mode.

### Theming

Most of the libraries are themeable and they usually offer a way to modify theme variables (colors, font sizes, etc.). However, I found that these central themes are either too simple (e.g. inverting colors in dark mode) or too complex to safely change (e.g. what is this shade of grey used for?). That's why you have multiple independent themes in basic-styled-uikit that are responsible for specific group of components.

### Technology

There are a lot of different technologies used for styling and each library picks one which ultimately affect (or even determines) the way you write css. Basic-styled-uikit is no exception and it uses styled-components under the hood. However, the only thing it imposes on you is to pass properly structured style object to theme providers and that's it. Apart from that, you're free to use whatever technology you want.
