### basic-styled-uikit

https://thegrinder.github.io/basic-styled-uikit

Basic-styled-uikit is a react UI components library built with styled-components. There are plenty of great UI libraries out there that offer
complete set of components, from simple buttons to more complex ones such as dropdowns or datepickers. Basic-styled-uikit is minimal on purpose.
It provides only basic (usually just one html tag) components and an easy way to add/customize their variations by using the theme. In other words,
it takes care of the basics and leaves the rest up to you.
